![LG Magic Remote](images/lg_magic_remote.png)

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive Linux kernel driver and toolset for the LG Magic Remote (MR20 and similar models). The driver enables full functionality of the remote including button mapping, gyroscopic airmouse control, and IMU data access. The package includes both a kernel module and Python utilities for calibration, testing, and visualization.

## Project Structure

### Kernel Module Files

- **kernel/dkms.conf** - DKMS configuration file for automated kernel module building
- **kernel/lg_magic_main.c** - Main kernel driver implementation
- **kernel/lg_magic_airmouse.h** - Header file for airmouse calibration structures
- **kernel/lg_magic_airmouse.c** - Airmouse calibration and filtering implementation
- **kernel/Makefile** - Build system for the kernel module
- **51-lgimu.rules** - Udev rule for non-root raw IMU access. Place to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` if needed.

### Voice Bridge

- **voice/lg_magic_voice.c** - Microphone bridge: reads mSBC audio from the remote over hidraw and publishes it as a PipeWire source
- **voice/Makefile** - Build and install the bridge
- **voice/lg-magic-voice.service** - systemd user unit for the bridge
- **52-lgmagic-hidraw.rules** - Udev rule granting the logged-in user access to the remote's hidraw node, required by the bridge

### Python Tools

- **scripts/lg_magic.py** - HIDRAW-level packet analyzer and debug tool. Initial tool, kept for historical reasons
- **scripts/calibrate.py** - IMU calibration utility (accelerometer and gyroscope)
- **scripts/convert_calib.py** - Converts JSON calibration to binary format for kernel module
- **scripts/display_imu.py** - Real-time IMU data visualization and airmouse emulation

## Kernel Module Features

### Device Support
- Supports LG Magic Remote (HID Bluetooth device 000f:3412, genuine MR18, MR19
  and MR20 firmware; the 2025 MR25 generation reports 005d:8762 and is not
  matched)
- Creates two input devices:
  - `LG Magic Remote` - Standard HID events (buttons, wheel, airmouse)
  - `LG Magic Remote IMU` - Raw IMU data (accelerometer + gyroscope)

### Button Mapping
Comprehensive button support including:
- Power, number keys (0-9), navigation buttons (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)
- Media controls (PLAY, PAUSE, VOLUME, MUTE)
- Color buttons (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE)
- Special function buttons (HOME, BACK, SETTINGS, GUIDE)

### Voice Input
- Microphone audio is mSBC on HID input report `0xFE` and is bridged into
  PipeWire by `voice/lg-magic-voice`, not by the kernel module
- The kernel module reports the microphone button as `KEY_VOICECOMMAND` and
  leaves the audio to the hidraw reader

### Device Interrogation
- Motion streaming is enabled at probe and after resume with the vendor command
  `F9 01`; without it the gyro and accelerometer fields are not populated
- Firmware version, region zone and the remote's own sensor calibration blob
  (SCD) are requested at probe and exposed through sysfs
- Battery level is decoded from the upper six bits of report byte 3

### Airmouse Functionality
**Needs calibration before usage**
- Gyroscope-based pointer control
- Configurable sensitivity and threshold
- Low-pass filtering for smooth movement
- Automatic mode switching between navigation and pointer control

The airmouse feature is implemented in two ways:
- **Kernel Module (Production)**: Built-in airmouse processing with minimal latency, running entirely in kernel space
- **Python + Uinput (Debug)**: Raw IMU data processing in userspace via `display_imu.py --mouse` for testing and calibration validation

### IMU Data Access
- Raw accelerometer and gyroscope data via evdev
- 6-axis motion data (3-axis accel + 3-axis gyro)
- Hardware counter for timing synchronization

## Building and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Linux kernel headers
- DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support)
- Build essentials (make, gcc)

### Manual Build
```bash
make
sudo insmod lg_magic.ko
```

### DKMS Installation
```bash
sudo mkdir /usr/src/lg-magic-1.0
sudo cp * /usr/src/lg-magic-1.0/
sudo dkms add -m lg-magic -v 1.0
sudo dkms build -m lg-magic -v 1.0
sudo dkms install -m lg-magic -v 1.0
```

### Module Parameters
The driver supports several runtime parameters:

```bash
# Load with custom parameters
sudo modprobe lg_magic airmouse=1 airmouse_threshold=300 imu_evdev=1 \
              motion=1 debug=2

# Or set via sysfs after loading
echo 1 > /sys/module/lg_magic/parameters/airmouse
echo 500 > /sys/module/lg_magic/parameters/airmouse_threshold
echo 2 > /sys/module/lg_magic/parameters/debug
```

**Parameters:**
- `airmouse` (0/1): Enable/disable airmouse functionality
- `airmouse_threshold` (int): Gyro threshold for enabling airmouse (default: 300)
- `imu_evdev` (0/1): Expose raw IMU data as separate input device
- `motion` (0/1): Ask the remote to stream motion samples (default: 1)
- `debug` (0-2): Debug message level (0=quiet, 1=normal, 2=verbose)

### Sysfs Attributes

Under the HID device directory, for example
`/sys/bus/hid/devices/0005:000F:3412.*/`:

- `fw_version`: firmware version string reported by the remote
- `fw_major`: firmware version byte the TV uses to gate further commands
- `fw_zone`: region zone byte
- `battery_level`: 0-63, decoded from report byte 3
- `scd`: the remote's sensor calibration blob as hex, empty until the remote
  answers `F9 17`. Only the chunk index and the "more chunks" flag of the
  response are documented, so the bytes are concatenated in arrival order and
  passed through unparsed

## Calibration System

### Calibration File Format
The driver loads calibration data from binary files via Linux Firmware subsystem:
- `lg_magic_calib_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX.bin` - MAC address-specific individual calibration
- `lg_magic_calib.bin` - Fallback calibration

### Creating Calibration Files

1. **Collect IMU samples for both calibrations:**
```bash
python3 display_imu.py --csv samples.csv
```

2. **Calculate calibration values:**
```bash
# Calibrate accelerometer (slowly rotate across all axes while collecting)
python3 calibrate.py --accel samples.csv calib_accel.json

# Calibrate gyroscope (keep remote stationary while collecting)
python3 calibrate.py --gyro samples.csv calib_gyro.json

# Combine Gyro/Accel JSONs
Combine gyro/accel sections. Adjust gyro scale. Out of scope of this project, recommended value about 0.07

```

3. **Convert to binary format:**
```bash
python3 convert_calib.py calib.json lg_magic_calib.bin --alpha 0.2 --mouse_k 0.5
```

### Calibration Parameters
- `alpha`: Low-pass filter coefficient (0.0-1.0)
- `mouse_k`: Airmouse sensitivity multiplier
- `gyro_bias`: Gyroscope zero-offset values
- `gyro_scale`: Gyroscope scaling factors

## Voice Input

The microphone is not autonomous: the host has to arm it by writing the vendor
command `F9 03` to the remote, after which the remote sends 124-byte `0xFE`
reports at 66.7 per second, each carrying two 60-byte HFP wideband blocks. Each
block is an H2 header plus a 57-byte mSBC frame, so one report is 15 ms of
16 kHz mono audio. This is a live stream, not a batched transfer, and the
bridge adds one PipeWire quantum of buffering on top of the 15 ms packetisation.

Decoding mSBC belongs in userspace, so `voice/lg-magic-voice` does the work: it
reads the same hidraw node the kernel module leaves open, arms and re-arms the
remote, decodes with `libsbc` and publishes a PipeWire source named
`lg-magic-voice` carrying S16LE mono at 16 kHz. Any PipeWire or PulseAudio
client can then record from it.

### Building and running

```bash
cd voice
make
sudo make install                 # /usr/local/bin and a systemd user unit

sudo cp ../52-lgmagic-hidraw.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger

systemctl --user enable --now lg-magic-voice.service
```

### Options

```bash
lg-magic-voice [-d /dev/hidrawN] [-m button|client|always] [-t ms] [-v]
```

- `-d`, `--device`: hidraw node of the remote; autodetected from
  `HID_ID=0005:0000000F:00003412` by default
- `-m`, `--mode`: when to arm the microphone
  - `button` (default): while the microphone button is held, plus a tail
  - `client`: whenever something is recording from the PipeWire source
  - `always`: keep the stream armed
- `-t`, `--tail`: how long to keep streaming after the button is released,
  milliseconds (default 1500)
- `-v`, `--verbose`: log state transitions

### Recording

```bash
pw-record --target lg-magic-voice --rate 16000 --channels 1 --format s16 out.wav
```

The bridge re-sends `F9 05` every 4 s while armed, because the remote stops
streaming by itself after about six seconds, and treats one second without an
`0xFE` report as the stream having died. If the remote answers with the in-band
stop code `0x800D` the stream is restarted while it is still wanted.

## Python Tools Usage

### lg_magic.py - Packet Analyzer
```bash
# Monitor HIDRAW packets
python3 lg_magic.py
```

### display_imu.py - IMU Visualization
```bash
# Raw IMU data display
python3 display_imu.py

# AHRS
python3 display_imu.py --calib calib.json --ahrs

# 3D orientation cube
python3 display_imu.py --calib calib.json --cube

# Uinput airmouse
python3 display_imu.py --calib calib.json --mouse
```

### Airmouse debug
The Python tools can create a virtual mouse device using uinput:

```bash
# Enable uinput module
sudo modprobe uinput

# Run airmouse with calibration
python3 display_imu.py --calib calib.json --mouse
```

## Technical Details

### HID Protocol Structure

The remote uses report ID `0xFD` (30-byte total: 1 byte report ID + 29 bytes payload). The payload structure is:

| Offset | Size | Description | Format |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | 1 | Report ID (0xFD) | uint8_t |
| 1-2 | 2 | Packet counter | little-endian uint16 |
| 3-4 | 2 | Constant value (0xFD00) | little-endian uint16 |
| 5-6 | 2 | Gyro X | big-endian int16 |
| 7-8 | 2 | Gyro Y | big-endian int16 |
| 9-10 | 2 | Gyro Z | big-endian int16 |
| 11-12 | 2 | Accel X | big-endian int16 |
| 13-14 | 2 | Accel Y | big-endian int16 |
| 15-16 | 2 | Accel Z | big-endian int16 |
| 17-18 | 2 | Button code | big-endian uint16 |
| 19 | 1 | Wheel delta | int8 |

The remote declares report `0xF9` as input, output and feature (the vendor
command channel), `0xFD` as input (motion and buttons) and `0xFE` as input
(voice, 124 bytes: report ID, a status byte, a big-endian 16-bit event code in
the same code space as the button field, then 120 bytes of audio as two 60-byte
blocks).

The vendor command channel `0xF9` carries a one-byte opcode after the report
ID. The ones this project uses are `0x01` motion active, `0x02` motion sleep,
`0x03`/`0x04`/`0x05` voice start, stop and restart, `0x11` read firmware
version and `0x17` read sensor calibration data. Writing to the vendor GATT
bank `d0ff` is a different matter entirely and must be avoided: writing `0x01`
to characteristic `ffd1` reboots the remote into its DFU bootloader.

### IMU Data Processing
- **Sampling rate**: ~50Hz (20ms intervals)
- **Data format**: Big-endian signed 16-bit values
- **Coordinate system**: Shown on image

### Airmouse Algorithm
1. Gyro data is bias-corrected and scaled
2. Low-pass filtering reduces high-frequency noise
3. Angular velocity is converted to pointer movement
4. Threshold detection switches between navigation and pointer modes. Pressing navigation buttons return to button mode.

## Not Implemented

Documented remote behaviour this project deliberately leaves alone:

- The infrared transmitter and the UEI code-set commands (`0xF9` opcodes `0x50`
  to `0x74`), which drive an external set-top box
- `0xF9 0x19` remote information and `0xF9 0x90` liquid detection
- Over-the-air firmware update over the `d0ff` GATT bank, which is one blind
  write away from stranding the remote in its bootloader
- Parsing the SCD blob into calibration values; the blob is exposed raw because
  its layout is not published
- The Broadcom generation (MR14 to MR16A), which is BR/EDR, identifies as
  `0a5c:8502` and uses the incompatible 22-byte report `0xFA`
